Little Birdy
============

Synopsis
--------

A collection of useful Ruby utilities and helpers, in a similar vein to
[Facets](https://github.com/rubyworks/facets). Feel free to suggest other
handy extensions and if I like them, I'll add them.

Features
--------

* Pretty String truncation with `String#ellipsize`
* Easy substitution with `String#gsub` and a hash
* Safe navigation with `_?`
* Ensured presence of `module_exec` and `instance_exec`
* `Kernel#Symbol` to accompany the similar `Kernel#String`
* And more...
